* Using git in working environment:
** clone a specific branch:
   git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>
** how to rolling back a remote git repo:
   You can use:
                 *git revert <commit>â€¦*
   for all the n commits, and then push as usual, 
   keeping history unchanged.

   Or you can "roll back" with 
                 *git reset --hard HEAD~n*
   
   If you are pushing in a public or shared repository, 
   you may diverge and break others work based on your 
   original branch. Git will prevent you doing so, but 
   you can use:
                 *git push -f* 
   to force the update.

** check a specific commit:
*** git log --oneline
    This will show the commit log one line on commit;
*** git show <revhash>
    <revhash> is the hash value of the commit you want to check;
* Unicode:
   A good artical about unicode: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/06/Unicode
   libxml webpage: http://xmlsoft.org/index.html
   use iconv change file encoding: iconv -f GB2312 -t UTF-8 zycp.txt > new_zycp.txt
* Rust:
** traits: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html
** traits object: 
   data     --> the object of the type which implements the *trait*
   behavior --> a vtable record the *trait behavior*
   trait object = data + behavior, is used to allow abstraction across common behavior(trait)
   the-rust-book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html
* Linux/Unix:
** add a task to systemed:
1. create a xxx.service file
   [Unit]
   Description=sslocal jump out service
   After=network.target
   StartLimitIntervalSec=0

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=1
   User=pi
   ExecStart=/home/pi/.local/bin/sslocal -c /etc/shadowsocks.json

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

2. mv this service file to /etc/systemd/system/

3. start the new system service: systemctl start xxx

4. auto get it start when you mechine reboot: systemctl enable xxx
** linux keyboard capslock remap as ctrl:
   On Raspbian, edit the file /etc/default/keyboard and then run sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration. 
   You may have to restart your terminal and/or the Pi for everything to take effect.

   The particulars of what you need to enter depend on what you want to do. For me, this:

   XKBMODEL="pc105"
   XKBLAYOUT="us"
   XKBVARIANT="altgr-intl"
   XKBOPTIONS="terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,ctrl:nocaps"

   makes sure I have US international keyboard layout and Caps Lock acts as Control (that's the ctrl:nocaps part).
   Find out more via man keyboard.
** grep out string in a directory:
   If your grep supports -R, do:
   grep -R 'string' dir/

   If not, then use find:
   find dir/ -type f -exec grep -H 'string' {} +
** find something with a specific time:
   https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-osxfind-files-by-date/
** something more about sed:
*** 'next' command for a single line:
    sed '/header/{n; d}' test.txt 
    the privious command will 'delete' the next line of the line which match 'header'
    so 'n' move to the next line, 'd' just delete it.
*** 'next' command for multiple line:
    The content of a file:
    This is the header line
    This is the first data line
    This is the second data line
    This is the last line

    run this command:
    sed '/first/{N; s/\n/ /}' test.txt

    this is the result:
    This is the header line
    This is the first data line This is the second data line
    This is the last line
 
    The content:
    This is a file from jiang
    heng thank you!
    
    run the following command:
    sed 'N; s/jiang.heng/heng\njiang/' test.txt

    the result:
    This is a file from heng
    jiang thank you!
** linux disk useage check:
   df 
   df -h
   df -k: show in 1024-bytes blocks
   df -T: show file system type
