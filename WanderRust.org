* "Clone on write": what this 'cow' did for you?
How a system programming progremmer what his data:
** exactly where your data lives,
** that it is efficiently stored,
** that it is removed as soon as you stop using it,
** and that you don’t copy it around needlessly.
If you want to write fast program, your data should be managed according the
previous standards.

Never copy your data if you have to copy it!

In Rust, the abbreviation “Cow” stands for “clone on write”.
It is an enum with two states: Borrowed and Owned. 

This means you can use it to abstract over whether you own the data 
or just have a reference to it. 

This is especially useful when you want to return a type from a function 
that may or may not need to allocate.
